# Analysis and Prediction Defaut Payment Credit Card

## Introductions
In this project, I conducted an analysis and prediction of customers' credit card payment capabilities. I collected the necessary dataset from Google BigQuery using SQL language. In developing the machine learning model, I utilized six different supervised learning algorithms, namely Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest, Decision Tree, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and Multilayer Perceptron Classifier (MLPC).

Through this project, my aim is to provide valuable insights to the company in managing credit risks, identifying customer payment patterns, and taking appropriate actions to optimize business decisions related to credit cards.
